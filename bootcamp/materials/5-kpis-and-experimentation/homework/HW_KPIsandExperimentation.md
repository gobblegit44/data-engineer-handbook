Ring Doorbell User Journey
Discovery (Initial Setup)
When I first encountered the Ring Doorbell, it was mostly due to word of mouth and seeing ads promoting its features like home security and convenience. The initial decision to purchase was driven by a mix of convenience (being able to see who’s at the door without getting up) and a desire for security. The purchase was simple via the Ring website, and the setup process was relatively straightforward.
Unboxing and Installation
The unboxing experience was clean, and I appreciated that everything needed for installation was included in the package: the doorbell unit, screws, a power drill guide, and even a level to ensure proper alignment. The instructions were clear, and within 30 minutes, I had the device installed and connected to my home Wi-Fi network. I was up and running fairly quickly, with minimal hassle. The mobile app guided me step-by-step through the setup, including linking the device to my phone.
Initial Use (Monitoring & Alerts)
After installation, I was eager to test the features. I set up motion detection alerts, and within a few minutes, I received my first notification when someone passed by the door. The Ring app was intuitive, and the video feed was clear, even in low-light conditions, thanks to the infrared night vision. I could interact with visitors through two-way audio, which made me feel secure and in control even when I wasn’t home.
Ongoing Use (Regular Monitoring)
Over time, I used the Ring Doorbell regularly to monitor deliveries, greet visitors remotely, or check on any suspicious activity. The motion detection was particularly useful when I was at work or out running errands, as I could get alerts for people coming to my door. The ability to review event history (video recordings) in the app also provided peace of mind.
Subscription (Ring Protect Plan)
After a few months, I decided to upgrade to a Ring Protect plan to gain access to video storage, which allowed me to review past footage beyond the default 24-hour window. This feature has been helpful for monitoring activity and having evidence in case of an incident, such as package theft or other disturbances. I felt the additional investment was worth it for the extra security.
Current Use
Now, the Ring Doorbell has become an integral part of my home security setup. I use it daily for monitoring visitors, managing deliveries, and enhancing my peace of mind when I’m not home. The device works seamlessly with other smart home devices. Over time, I’ve also gotten used to the occasional “motion detected” notifications, which have become a familiar part of my daily routine.

3 probable Experiments to Improve the Ring Doorbell Experience
Experiment 1: Improving Motion Detection Accuracy

Test Design:
Test Groups:
Control Group (A): Standard motion detection algorithm as is (based on current settings such as person detection, motion zones, and sensitivity).
Test Group (B): Improved motion detection with AI/ML-powered filtering that better distinguishes between human movement, pets, and other irrelevant motion, reducing false alerts.
Test Group (C): Customizable motion zones with more granular control, allowing users to set the sensitivity level in different areas (e.g., lower sensitivity near trees or high traffic areas, higher sensitivity directly at the door).
Metrics:
Leading Metrics: Frequency of false alerts, user engagement with motion detection settings (e.g., adjustments to zones and sensitivity), and notification response rates (whether users view the alert or dismiss it).
Lagging Metrics: Increased user satisfaction, fewer missed alerts for actual visitors or important events, and higher retention due to reduced notification fatigue.
Hypothesis: By reducing false alerts and giving users more control over motion detection zones, Ring can reduce annoyance and increase the reliability of the system, leading to higher engagement and user satisfaction.
Experiment 2: Enhancing Video Storage and Accessibility

Test Design:
Test Groups:
Control Group (A): Users continue to have 24-hour video storage with the option to subscribe to Ring Protect for longer storage.
Test Group (B): Users are given 7 days of video storage for free (or a tier-based offering), allowing for more time to review footage without needing a paid plan.
Test Group (C): Video storage comes with smart categorization (e.g., "package delivery," "visitor," "motion detected") that helps users find specific events quickly, along with an option for a custom retention period.
Metrics:
Leading Metrics: Usage of video playback, number of video clips viewed per user, and frequency of searches for specific events (e.g., package deliveries).
Lagging Metrics: Subscription rate for Ring Protect, user satisfaction with video storage, reduced anxiety related to lost video footage, and retention of users over time.
Hypothesis: Expanding free storage and improving video categorization would enhance the user experience by giving users easier access to their video history, leading to higher engagement and potentially more upgrades to the premium Ring Protect plan.
Experiment 3: Social & Neighborhood Integration for Alerts and Sharing

Test Design:
Test Groups:
Control Group (A): Users only receive notifications for their doorbell and can share video recordings manually if desired.
Test Group (B): Users can join a "Neighborhood" network where they can share video footage of local security events (e.g., package thefts, break-ins, suspicious activity) with other nearby Ring users.
Test Group (C): Users can set up neighborhood-specific alerts (e.g., "suspicious person spotted in the area") that notify them when similar events are detected in their neighborhood.
Metrics:
Leading Metrics: Number of interactions with neighborhood posts (shares, comments, alerts received), frequency of users actively participating in the neighborhood network.
Lagging Metrics: Increase in user engagement with the Ring app, higher adoption rate of neighborhood alerts, improved perception of safety, and longer retention as users feel more connected to a community.
Hypothesis: Integrating social and neighborhood-specific features will make users feel more connected and proactive about local security, leading to higher engagement and retention. Additionally, it may drive more users to upgrade to paid plans for enhanced functionality and to participate in community-based security efforts.
